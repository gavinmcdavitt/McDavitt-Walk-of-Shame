# McDavitt-Walk-of-Shame
This will record the progress of the McDavitt Walk of Shame of 2024 - 2025. The basis of the project is my family and I will pick NFL football games. Loser has to walk the St Marks Tallahassee Trail. I wanted to use the data from this spreadsheet to build a website with a good UI, and can hold videos and photos from our event.

In main.py, there is a setup function which will be able to grab all of the upcoming games and lines before games start. Ensure you run this before games start.
On Monday, I will have another funciton that will grab the winners and help each team figure out the winners.
